Canção do Africano,Nação Karirí,"Lá na úmida senzala Sentado na estreita sala Junto o braseiro, no chão Entoa o escravo o seu canto E ao cantar correm-lhe em pranto Saudades do seu torrão De um lado, uma negra escrava Os olhos no filho crava Que tem no colo a embalar E à meia voz lá responde Ao canto, e o filhinho esconde Talvez, pra não o escutar Minha terra é lá bem longe Das bandas de onde o Sol vem Esta terra é mais bonita Mas à outra eu quero bem O Sol faz lá tudo em fogo Faz em brasa toda a areia Ninguém sabe como é belo Ver de tarde a papa-ceia! Aquelas terras tão grandes Tão compridas como o mar Com suas poucas palmeiras Dão vontade de pensar Lá todos vivem felizes Todos dançam no terreiro A gente lá não se vende Como aqui, só por dinheiro O escravo calou a fala Porque na úmida sala O fogo estava a apagar E a escrava acabou seu canto Pra não acordar com o pranto O seu filhinho a sonhar! O escravo então foi deitar-se Pois tinha de levantar-se Bem antes do Sol nascer E se tardasse, coitado Teria de ser surrado Pois bastava escravo ser Minha terra é lá bem longe Das bandas de onde o Sol vem Esta terra é mais bonita Mas à outra eu quero bem! O Sol faz lá tudo em fogo Faz em brasa toda a areia Ninguém sabe como é belo Ver de tarde a papa-ceia!

Cansaço,Alec' (BR),"De novo eu acordei cansado amor, de novo eu tô Paciência no limite do meu voo Tão pouco sei o que existe, e o que eu sou E o que me resta são migalhas de tudo que sobrou Então não olha para mim Diz se é tão fácil de me machucar assim Despido de mim, despido do mundo Desprotegido de todo mundo Me pergunta se magoa e eu digo que sim Eu tô tão magoado ao ponto de viver E, ao mesmo tempo feliz de ter que estar aqui E eu sei que eu tenho tanto pra esquecer Mas as mágoas do meu passado não me deixam mentir Será que sou eu ou as mudanças? Os milhares de motivos que levam a vingança Por que impedir minha mente de ir onde ele alcança? E o que cansa, por que que tudo é injusto eu era só uma criança Me cansa tanto ver as noites belas, vazias Enxergo o tanto e quantas partes dela eu trazia Será que é natural falar ou natural xingar Que eu vivo em barreiras que eu não consigo quebrar Como demonstrar afeto se eu não tenho em mim Como viver de amor com um eu tão inseguro Como florescer as rosas do meu jardim? São problemas normais porque eu não me desculpo Como demonstrar afeto se eu não tenho em mim Como viver de amor com um eu tão inseguro Como florescer as rosas do meu jardim? São problemas normais porque eu não me desculpo A tanto tempo eu não converso, eu não desabafo Eu ando me afogando em verso, rap e compassos Passos que me levam ao inverso do que eu faço Desilusões eu não entrego, somente passo Tão novo e carregando o mundo Tenho tanta coisa eu não quero cuidar de tudo Sou tão pequenino para o tamanho do mundo, o tempo é tão curto A vida passa como um sopro eu não quero perder um segundo Então será que eu sou tão mau assim Ou nunca quis me entregar? Então será que o trauma vive em mim Ou eu que não sei me cuidar? Então será que eu sou tão mau assim Ou eu não soube enxergar Apesar de eu ser tão ruim Eu nunca quis me machucar De novo eu acordei cansado, amor De novo eu tô, paciência no limite do meu voo Tão pouco sei o que existe e o que eu sou E o que me resta são migalhas de tudo que sobrou Então não olha para mim Diz se é tão fácil de me machucar assim Despido de mim, despido do mundo Desprotegido de todo o mundo Me pergunte se magoa e eu digo que sim",447,pt,negative,0.7035531997680664,-0.7035531997680664
